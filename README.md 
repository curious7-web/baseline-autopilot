Baseline Autopilot is a complete tooling ecosystem that eliminates the guesswork of browser support, giving developers the confidence to write modern code.

## The Problem

Every web developer wastes time worrying, "Is this new web feature safe to use yet?" This uncertainty is a tax on productivity, forcing us to jump between MDN and `caniuse.com` instead of building.

---
## The Solution

Baseline Autopilot solves this problem by integrating Baseline data directly into the developer workflow. It's an intelligent system that not only warns you about non-baseline features but also provides safe, automated fallbacks.

---
## ✨ Key Features

This project is a complete ecosystem with four main components:

* **✅ Command-Line Scanner**: A powerful CLI tool (`npm run scan`) to audit and fix an entire codebase at once.
* **📄 Premium Web Report**: Generates a polished HTML report (`npm run demo`) with a full "Scan Insights" dashboard, browser compatibility data, and a side-by-side diff viewer.
* **🎮 Interactive Web Playground**: A live web app (`npm run playground`) where anyone can paste code and see it get analyzed and fixed in real-time.
* **🛡️ Automated CI/CD Guard**: A GitHub Action that can be configured to prevent non-baseline code from ever being merged.
